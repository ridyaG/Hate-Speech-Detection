# Hate-Speech-Detection
This project focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques to categorize a piece of text into three distinct categories, which are "hate speech", "offensive language" and "neither".

This python project analyses twitter data to identify hate speech and creates a machine learning model based on the dataset. The dataset is available on kaggle. The dataset contains labels indicating the tweets are hate speech or not. Label 0 indicates hate speech, Label 1 indicates offesive-language and label 3 indicates non-hate speech tweets.
